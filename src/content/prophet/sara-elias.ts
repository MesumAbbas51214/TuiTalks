    "Sara Elias keeps a stack of tactile tiles by her desk. The industrial designer invites visitors to run their fingers over each pattern while she explains how texture can guide students with low vision from the library atrium to the counselling wing.",
    "Her inclusive design studio—nicknamed The Map Room—pairs architecture majors with disability advocates to prototype quick fixes: magnetic wayfinding strips, adjustable lighting kits, and fold-out rest nooks that clip to standard hallway rails.",
    "The team pilots every idea with student volunteers. ‘We capture audio diaries, not just survey forms,’ Elias says, noting that the best insights come from stories about the routes people avoid. That qualitative data is now part of the facilities team’s renovation checklist.",
    "Elias is lobbying for a community build day where alumni can sponsor bench installations and sign-language-friendly info kiosks. She hopes the concept will ripple out to partner campuses who are tackling similar accessibility gaps.",
