    "When John Henderson took over the Black Lake Theatre Society, he promised more room for experimentation. Two semesters later, the troupe has staged three original productions and a campus-wide improv night that drew the largest turnout in the club’s history.",
    "‘We treat rehearsal like a laboratory,’ he says, recalling how he encourages performers to rewrite scenes together. Henderson credits his mentor, Professor Estrella, for insisting every production schedule include time for reflection walks and open-mic story circles.",
    "Students across disciplines now wander into auditions just to watch the trust exercises—rope climbs, guided storytelling, and a pre-show gratitude roll call that Henderson swears by. The routine has become a safe haven for first-years who want to stretch their creative muscles without the pressure of perfection.",
    "Next up is a devised piece about leaving home, co-written with second-year cinematography students. Henderson hopes it becomes the spark for a travelling production that visits partner colleges across the region.",
