    "Why don’t you write a book? he asked me —  sitting at Mensa on a rainy day when the sun kept slipping through in the last breath of summer.  “You could be a writer. *With a master's degree.*”  And now… here we are.  Life takes sudden turns we never plan for.  We’re surrounded by people — classmates, colleagues, friends —  but how many do we actually *know*?  We ask:  “How was your weekend?”  “What did you have for lunch?”  But we rarely ask:  “What’s been heavy on your heart lately?”  “What excites you so much you lose track of time?”  Sometimes a stranger appears and suddenly — without warning —  you find pieces of yourself in their story.  Campus life is strange like that.  There are so many familiar faces —  surely we’ve stood in line at Netto together,  sat at opposite ends of the same library table,  shared a nod on the bus.  And over time, we draw silent sketches of each other:  a glance here, an outfit there,  a vibe we *think* we understand.  But we don’t.  Until we talk.  And suddenly —  we realize we share the same questions.  “How do I finish this degree?”  “When will I get that job?”  “Will I ever feel like I belong here?”  Our paths *look* the same.  But they’re not.  That’s the beauty of it.  On a planet orbiting a star 1.3 million times bigger than itself,  in a galaxy with 100 billion stars,  among 2 trillion other galaxies we’ve only *begun* to map...  We still walk the same hallways.  Sit on the same benches.  Order the same Mensa coffee.  But one person’s walking to forget.  Another’s walking to *prove* something.  Some of us are chasing dreams.  Some are just surviving the week.  It looks the same.  But it’s not.  That’s why we talk.  And not just because there’s space and we need to fill it —  but to listen.  To catch the tremble in someone’s laugh.  To hear the part they didn’t say out loud.  To sit beside their silence and still feel close.  We talk to feel less alone in this spinning chaos —  To say, “Hey, I’ve been there.”  Or better yet —  *“Tell me more.”*  And maybe that’s why…  **Small talk was never really small.**",
    "Do you have a passion? Do you pursue it? I used to think writing was mine. But I didn’t realize then that having a passion doesn’t just mean thinking about what you’d like to do in your free time.It means building your life around it. I believe that when you follow your passion — truly — life starts to make a little more sense. Decisions get clearer. The grind feels lighter. You stop surviving and start living. His passion is games. Not just playing them — but creating them. Taking an idea from his mind, shaping it, designing it, and turning it into something you can feel, control, explore. He grew up in Karachi — the third-largest city in the world — a place where life often feels more about making it through the day than dreaming big. Where choosing survival over creativity is the norm. But he didn’t want to be just another product of the system. He held onto his passion like a compass. And that compass brought him to Germany. Here, he studied, worked in the industry for two years — soaking in everything he could. And now? Now he’s building something of his own. A startup. A dream he’s shaping line by line, frame by frame, into a world we can one day play through.",
    "I will start the recording now, I told him.Placed my phone in the middle of the table. Two chairs across each other. Group Room 3 of the campus library.And I felt it — the tension. Crawling up into my body like a guest I didn’t invite.You’re ready, Mesum, I told myself. Deep breath.Exhale it out.Take control now, I mumbled under my breath.Then I looked up and asked the first question.And just like that — I saw the stress leap across the table into him.His body shifted. Arms dropped from the desk to his knees. Back stiffened. He looked at me like I’d asked something heavier than I did.Relax, I said. It’s not an interrogation. I just want to talk.And in that tiny pause, my brain flicked a question back at me:Why’s he nervous? Shouldn’t I be?Humans are weird.I’m the one hosting the interview, the one who’s been thinking about this for weeks — but he’s the one being seen. He’s the one on record. Being listened to, maybe later being read by people he doesn’t even know. People tense up when they’re about to share parts of themselves — even when they’re just talking to a friend.",
    "Elias is lobbying for a community build day where alumni can sponsor bench installations and sign-language-friendly info kiosks. She hopes the concept will ripple out to partner campuses who are tackling similar accessibility gaps.",

      "Picture the spread on Dailymotion: the columns breathe, the sidebar’s black line pins the parchment in place, and then everything pauses. That same line becomes a divider, a cue that the tone can shift. Underneath it, the narration can stretch out, get more personal, invite sketches and notes that don’t quite fit the prim columns above.",
      "This is where the real tinkering happens. We can drop in follow-ups from the interview, progress logs from the startup build, or sketches from campus conversations. The black stroke gives readers permission to scroll past the formal story and watch the work-in-progress unfold — a living development diary stitched right under the feature.",
